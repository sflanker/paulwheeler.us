  - title: Image Dithering as N-Queens Problem
    authors: Paul Wheeler, M. Morse, V. Misic, P. Anderson
    publication: 2004 Proceedings, Conference on Artificial Neural Networks in Engineering
    description: "By expanding on a basic genetic algorithm for solving the N-Queens problem we were able to develop a method for generating high quality noise masks that could be used in image dithering producing results superior to traditional algorithms. In order to produce the results for the paper I implemented the expanded genetic algorithm in both Matlab and C++."
