            I write code, design systems, invent solutions, and lead teams not only for a living, but also as a passion.
            I love the power of technology and using it to empower others.
            I've been writing software ever since I was introduced to Visual Basic in middle school (1990s).

            I have been fortunate enough to take a couple of breaks from my career to sail my 38 foot Hans Christian sloop to various destinations throughout the Pacific Ocean.
            Sailing from California to destinations including Mexico, Hawaii, and French Polynesia were some of the most amazing experiences of my life.
            On top of that, keeping the ship and her crew sailing smoothly was an exciting challenge which taught me many lessons.

            The same creative and problem solving mindset that I find so useful when developing software, has lead me to enjoy a number of different creative hobbies outside the digital realm.
            I enjoy designing and building carpentry, furniture, and small woodworking projects.
            Making home brewed beer is another pursuit that I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of.
            I find that the blend of creative freedom, and the importance of chemistry and precision, to be particularly rewarding, not to mention the end result üçª.

            Physical activity and outdoor adventure have always been a big draw for me, but as of late I have really gotten in to road cycling.
            Since 2017 I've gone from having limited road cycling experience, to riding 100+ miles on a weekly basis, racing competitively, and participating as a race volunteer and organizer.
            In 2019 I joined the board of the <a href="https://www.asbra.org">Aloha State Bicycle Racing Association</a> to help foster bicycle racing in Hawaii.
            I recently stepped down from the board due to other demands on my time, but I still maintain the ASBRA website and help out with timing for races.
            I ride and race with <a href="https://www.outtaboundshawaii.com/">Outta Bounds Hawaii Cycling Team</a>.
